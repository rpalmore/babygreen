      <h2>Plant care</h2>
      <p>This page should list, by a heading of most recent date (Monday, March 28), which plants were watered. You can click on any plant in the list to go to its detail page, much like the "My plants" page. The purpose of the page is to offer a quick snapshot of which plants were last watered or otherwise treated if other options are included.</p>
