## Description

baby green is a simple app to help you track the health of your plant babies. Easily capture every time you water, feed, repot or treat your plants. You can also add notes and photos when you have other data you want to keep track of. When did you last water your cactus? Did your rubber tree start dropping leaves? Is your fern loving its new, sunny spot? 

I built this app using Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, BootstrapVue, Vue.js, Vue Router, Vuex, Cloudinary, JavaScript, CSS and HTML after completing Tech Elevator's 14-week full-stack bootcamp in February 2022. 

Some starter code was provided for this application as part of the bootcamp, including authentication, registration and login functionality.

<!-- This directory contains all of the starter projects for the final capstone. The Vue starter project works with both the Java and .NET backend projects with a single configuration update that you can read about in the README.

Each project contains instructions that provides information about the starting code and explains how to get started with the final capstone project. -->
