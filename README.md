# baby green

A simple app to help you track the health of your plant babies by letting your easily capture every treatment (watering, fertilizing, repotting, etc.) and add notes and photos when more detailed information is needed. When did you last water your cactus? Did your rubber tree start dropping leaves? Is your fern doing OK in its new spot? Did you get rid of those spider mites???

This is a work in progress and will be available online in May 2022.
